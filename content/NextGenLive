# Everything you need to know 

 

## What are Monitoring Location Pages? 

Monitoring location pages are web pages that the USGS Water Mission Area offers to display important water data like discharge (also referred to as streamflow), gage height, precipitation, water-levels, temperature, etc. Thousands of people use USGS water data each month to make decisions ranging from recreation to emergency management.

## Why Are We Changing Them? 

### Thanking Outdated Technology 

The original monitoring location pages have largely looked the same since their inception in 1995. We are confident they were one of the first displays of real-time water-data anywhere in the world at a time when the web was only 5 years old and rarely displayed “live” content of any kind. Wow! 

The technology used to produce the original pages, what we call legacy pages, is now outdated, and prevents crucial updates from being made. But we need to meet accessibility standards, stay modern, and increase user satisfaction, so we have created new, Next Generation monitoring location pages. We give thanks to the decades of skilled software-programming work put into the legacy pages and we recognize how much they have provided to the public. We are thrilled to modernize our water data delivery as we “go live” with the NextGen pages.

{{< figure src="/static/FILENAMEHEREforlegacyscreenshot.png" caption="Here’s an example of a legacy page, showing monitoring location 01584050 LONG GREEN CREEK AT GLEN ARM, MD." alt="Screen capture of a legacy monitoring location page for 01584050 LONG GREEN CREEK AT GLEN ARM, MD." >}}
</div> 

## What Does “Live” Mean? 

NextGen pages have been online and accessible for approximately two years, in what we have called the beta stage of our agile development process. Beta means the pages are accessible to the public and available for user testing. During beta, we have made many changes. 

When NextGen pages go live in October 2021, they will become the default page for search engines and for web traffic. The old legacy pages will still be useable for a while longer, but around March 2022 your web browser will be redirected away from them by default. By January 2023 we expect to decommission these legacy real-time pages entirely, meaning you will no longer be able to view them.

## Pages Continue to Improve 

### You spoke, We Listened! #WeHeardYou 

During this beta phase of the next generation pages, we asked you, the user, how these pages could better serve you. Pages will continue to be improved iteratively to create discoverable, accessible, and usable Water Data for the Nation.  

### How We Work 

Learn more about how we work and use the agile development process to display high quality water information. Discover how we’ve improved the pages so far. 

 

## How Are NextGen Pages Different from Legacy Pages? 

These NextGen pages have new features, offering more than just a 1:1 replacement of legacy pages. 

### 5 Key Differences 

<b>Data-first:</b> Hydrograph at top, except for key alerts 

<b>Interactive:</b> Featuring a clickable, zoomable hydrograph with the ability to compare prior data 

<b>Compact & Mobile-First:</b> More things on one page – monitoring location metadata, water-data inventory, groundwater data, interactive map, etc, all summarized on one page 

<b>Geo-located:</b> Featuring a map with flowlines, shaded watershed area, and nearby monitoring locations 

<b>Affiliated networks:</b> A monitoring location belong to larger groupings of monitoring locations, and these pages let you explore those groupings to see the bigger picture of water resources
